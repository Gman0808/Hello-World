# A Lovely Night

## Concept
A dark and dreary, platformer where the player must survive as long as they can.
## Genre
A Lovely Night is a side-scrolling, never-ending platformer.
       
## Platform
For now desktop browsers only, however depending on development there could be a chance of a port to mobile devices.
## Story:
              
You are a lone child walking through an old town, attempting to survive whatever lurks in the unknown.
Overall there is little direct narrative or premise, however there will be subtle clues to a story in the background of the game.
     
## Esthetics:
### Visuals
  The game will have a very retro-pixel art style. The game's art style will be cartoonish, similar to games like Earthbound and Lisa. The game's art style will change as the game progresses, slowly turning into something looking like horrifying LSD trip.<p>
  
  ### Sound
Sound will be a very important aspect of this game. There will be no music throughout the game, instead there will be subtle ambient sounds. The play will need to listen to the background ambient ence to know if certain enemies are nearby. The overall tone of the ambients will change depending on how many enemies are around. For the most part, the ambients will be used primarily to build tension between enemy encounters.
 ## Gameplay
### Mechanics and Controls:        
The Main mechanics of the game is player can move left,right, jump upwards, and fall downwards.(This will be controlled with wasd). The player will also be able to hide behind bushes or inside of garbage cans, to avoid enemies.(This will be done by pressing E when near the right object). The level will constantly move to the right and so the player must constantly try to avoid any deadly traps or monsters. 
The game will be very slowly paced and there will be multiple moments of no enemies appearing to suddenly a horde of them.
### The Monsters:
 There will be a wide variety of enemies and traps, each become more deadly as the game progresses. All enemies will be impossible to to kill, and the player will only be able to avoid them. Each enemy will be very unique from one another and different methods will need to be done to avoid them. For example: there might be an enemy that will try to attack the player if they see them. Another might kill the player if they get too close, regardless of whether the player is hiding or not. 
  
 ### Ideas that might be included:
            
- The game might get darker as it progresses, to the point where it will be impossible to see the surroundings. The player will get a flashlight controlled by the mouse, so they can always see some of the level.
- There might be different levels, save points, and an ending. Doing this could make the game feel more complete and satisfying. For now the game is pitched as one never ending level, but this may be subject to change.

## About the Developer
 Not much is known about the Developer, Matt Oelbaum. Rumors have it he was last seen as student of the Rochester Institute of Technology, but this has yet to be confirmed. Some believe he has a sick obsession with horror and mystery games, while others believe he has a severe addiction to bubble tea. All we know for sure is he loves his dogs and he's probably a cannibal.
